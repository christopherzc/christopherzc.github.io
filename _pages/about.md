I'm a 1st year PhD Student at UC San Diego, advised by Dr. Prithviraj Ammanabrolu in the PEARLS Lab, united in our love for boba tea and our interest in embodied RL agents and interactive, human-aligned AI systems. 

In general, I am interested in all things Natural Language Processing (NLP), Reinforcement Learning (RL) and any systems that collaborate with people to improve the human experience as a whole. I see the future of AI as one where people work alongside intelligent systems rather than one where we are replaced by them.

In otherwords, I want AI to do my laundry and help me write. Not do the writing for me while I do my laundry.

Prior to this, I did my Master's at the Georgia Institute of Technology under the guidance of Dr. Thad Starner and Dr. Mark Riedl. While I was not fortunate enough to have the bandwidth to do research with him, I also served as the Head Graduate Teaching Assistant for Dr. Thomas Ploetz, who in turn served as an amazing mentor as well.

# Research Highlights:

I'm the Research Lead/Technical Co-lead/CEO/whatever for Socratic Mind, a tool for conducting scalable oral assessments with AI. Our work was chosen in the [2024 Tools Competition](https://tools-competition.org/). Try a demo [here](https://socraticmind.com).

If you are interested in getting involved, either in building Socratic Mind or deploying it in your classroom, please email BOTH chris@socraticmind.com and ray@socraticmind.com

More stuff coming soon (still working on getting spun up at UCSD). Check out the other [cool stuff my labmates are working on](https://pearls-lab.github.io/people/)!
