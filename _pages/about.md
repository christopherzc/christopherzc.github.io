I'm a 1st year PhD Student at UC San Diego, advised by Dr. Prithviraj Ammanabrolu in the PEARLS Lab, united in our love for boba tea and our interest in embodied RL agents and interactive, human-aligned AI systems. 

Prior to this, I did my Master's at the Georgia Institute of Technology with several amazing mentors. With Dr. Thad Starner, I headed the EdTools research team, building solutions for the common problems that instructors face as their classrooms expand from tens to hundreds of students. With Dr. Mark Riedl, I studied Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents in Text-Adventure Games and Story Generation focusing on persona-driven agents in open-ended environments. While I was not fortunate enough to have the bandwidth to do research with him, I also served as the Head Teaching Assistant for Dr. Thomas Ploetz. 

In general, I am interested in all things Natural Language Processing (NLP) and any systems that collaborate with people to improve the human experience as a whole. I see the future of AI as one where people work alongside intelligent systems rather than one where we are replaced by them.
