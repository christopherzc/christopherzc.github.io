Q: Research Lead/Technical Co-lead/CEO/Whatever?

A: Socratic Mind is tied to Ray and I more than any professor at GT, so we recieved the funds from the ToolsCompetition as individuals. To do this, we made a company of which I am technically the CEO. Other than this, I generally steer the more research-y aspects of SM and sit in on most meetings. 

I've served as a reviewer for the following conferences:

- ICLR 2024
- NeurIPS 2024
- ACL 2024 (Wordplay)
- IEEE Transactions on Games
- AIIDE 2024
