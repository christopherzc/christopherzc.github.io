# [Neural Story Planning](/publication/2023-Neural-Story-Planning)

We present a method for story plot generation that combines causal planning with neural language models. By using commonsense knowledge to recursively expand story plots in a backward chaining fashion, our system improves narrative coherence. Automatic evaluations show that this approach generates more coherent plotlines than several strong baselines.
