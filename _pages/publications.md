title: "Neural Story Planning"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-Neural-Story-Planning
excerpt: "We present a method for story plot generation that combines causal planning with neural language models. By using commonsense knowledge to recursively expand story plots in a backward chaining fashion, our system improves narrative coherence. Automatic evaluations show that this approach generates more coherent plotlines than several strong baselines."
