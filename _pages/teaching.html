    <h3><strong>Special Case (Spring 2023):</strong></h3>
    <p>During Spring 2023, Dr. Starner taught a 900-student, in-person class due to a lack of available instructors. To manage this, students were split into 9 auxiliary classrooms with a main classroom broadcast to the other rooms. To motivate attendance, the attending GTAs taught "mini-lessons" in fields related to their research. I was the lead for the NLP specialization classroom.</p>
