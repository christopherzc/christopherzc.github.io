*In Spring of 2023, Dr. Starner was asked to teach a 900 student, in-person class due to a lack of available instructors. To do this, the students were split into 9 auxiliary classrooms with a main classroom that was broadcasted to all other auxiliary rooms. To motivate student attendence, the auxiliary classrooms had the attending GTAs teach 'mini-lessons' in fields related to their research. I was the lead for the NLP specialization classroom.
